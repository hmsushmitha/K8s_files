Studio Ghibli is the project I worked as kubernetes and automation engineer.
Studio-Ghibli is a booking platform for acting classes. Here we used microservices architecture approach to build the application.
Each micro services where dockerized and deployed on Kubernetes cluster.
As a kubernetes engineer I was reposible for writing the all the required yaml files for each microservice.
This Repo contains all the yaml files written.
